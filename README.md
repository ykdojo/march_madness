# March Madness Prediction
I made a least square model for predicting winners of March Madness, the national college basketball tournament in the United States.

I built this model with different types of regularizations (L1 and L2), utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy and matplotlib. I ranked at the 32nd place out of 248 teams at the Kaggle competition.

**For the main code, please take a look at [predict_and_test.ipynb](predict_and_test.ipynb)**
